# Weather
A very basic Weather App - Using unchanged basic data under open licence using Open Weather




 
The basic guides available for git hub are useless...
the following is also necessary


git push --force  origin master  *for when it gives you loads of crap about remote master being out of date
git remote -v                     * fors seeing the origin that will already exist when you create the readmme file
                                  * the repository asks you create
git remote show origin            * too see what the hell is going on with origin 
git remote rename origin oldrepo  * to rename origin if you want to keep it 
git remote rm origin              * to delete it - if you know it shoulnt be there in the first palce

then 

you  do

https://github.com/your_user/your_app.git
e.g
To https://github.com/ftobin01/Weather.git                               
                                      
then it tells you it rejects it  because it claims the local is more   up to date..
git push  origin master * produces the following even though    its anew repsoitory
 [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
and of course pull or fetch doesnt sort this out...unless you been doing ti for years or something
The provided so called Cheat Sheet should be thrown in the bin..

CIAK lives on...
