# Weather
A very basic Weather App - Using unchanged basic data under open licence using Open Weather




PS:
The basic guides available for git hub are useless...
the following is also necessary


git push --force  origin master 

*for when it gives you loads of crap about remote master being out of date

git remote -v 

* fors seeing the origin that will already exist when you create the readmme file
                                  * the repository asks you create

git remote show origin           

* too see what the hell is going on with origin

git remote rename origin oldrepo 
* to rename origin if you want to keep it 


git remote rm origin              * to delete it - if you know it shoulnt be there in the first palce

then 

you  do

https://github.com/your_user/your_app.git
e.g
To https://github.com/ftobin01/Weather.git                               
                                      

then it tells you it rejected it  because it  the local is more up to date..

300 files and it stops because one tiny file may have changed???
GitHUB more like GODHELPUS ...

Why?

IF This all happens when i am finished a project god help anyone trying to use tis in the middle of a project.

========
E.G.
========

git push  origin master * produces the following even though    its anew repsoitory


 [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
 
 
and of course pull or fetch doesnt sort this out...unless
you been doing it for years or something


The provided so called Cheat Sheet on the GitHub Website should be thrown in the bin..


see the  start of this page if for the answer.
CIAK lives on...
